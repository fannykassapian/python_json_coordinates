# python_json_coordinates

This project follows my notebooks on dimensionality reduction. It uses the resulting embedding to create a JSON of coordinates. The aim is to plot these data elements as markers on a web map using Leaflet.

I explain how to do so in this article: https://medium.com/@fannykassapian/how-to-build-a-non-geographical-map-2-340256ad9f16

You can also find the code for the web map on my CodePen: https://codepen.io/fannykassapian/pen/qJOvbB
